# AR Model of Neural Networks for a Collaborative Approach to Explainable AI

## Overview

This project is part of a Bachelor thesis that explores the development of an Augmented Reality (AR) model of Neural Networks aimed at fostering a collaborative understanding of explainable AI. By leveraging AR technology, this project expands on the existing Virtual Reality (VR) framework to create a multi-user, interactive learning environment that enhances the comprehension of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

## Features

- **Augmented Reality (AR) Integration:** Users can visualize and interact with neural network models in a real-world environment using AR.
- **Collaborative Learning Environment:** Supports multi-user sessions where multiple participants can explore and learn together.
- **Forward Propagation Simulation:** Visualizes the process of forward propagation in neural networks.
- **Real-Time Synchronization:** Ensures consistent experiences across all users in a shared AR environment.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with inclusivity and ease of use in mind, offering hand-tracking and controller-based interactions.
- **Learning Stations:** Interactive stations that provide foundational knowledge about neural networks, including detailed explanations of layers and activation functions.

These features combine to create an immersive educational experience, making complex AI concepts more accessible and understandable for users at various levels of expertise.

## Technical Setup

The project is built using the Unity Engine (version 2021.3.30f1) and targets the Android platform, specifically the Meta (Oculus) Quest 3. The Meta XR SDK and Unity Netcode for Game Objects are utilized to support AR and multi-user functionality.

### Key Technologies:

- **Unity Engine**: For developing the AR and VR components.
- **Meta XR SDK**: For AR interaction and multi-user support.
- **Unity Netcode**: For networked real-time synchronization.
- **C#**: The primary programming language used in the development.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Unity (ensure you have version 2021.3.30f1 installed).
3. Set up the project for the Meta Quest 3 by configuring the build settings for Android.
4. Build and run the project on your Meta Quest 3 device.

## Usage

1. Launch the application on your Meta Quest 3.
2. Choose between VR and AR modes from the main menu.
3. Interact with the neural network models and learning stations.
4. In a multi-user session, collaborate with other participants by sharing learning stations and interacting with the models together.
